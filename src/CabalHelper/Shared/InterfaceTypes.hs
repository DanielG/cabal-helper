Module      : CabalHelper.Shared.InterfaceTypes
Description : Types which are used by c-h library and executable to communicate
License     : AGPL-3

These types are used to communicate between the cabal-helper library and main
executable, using Show/Read. If any types in this module change the major
version must be bumped since this will be exposed in the @Distribution.Helper@
module.

The cached executables in @$XDG_CACHE_DIR/cabal-helper@ use the cabal-helper
version (among other things) as a cache key so we don't need to worry about
talking to an old executable.
